**The EarlyPrint Library is a substantial down payment on a larger project that aims at creating a deduplicated digital library of most English books published before 1700.** Each item in the EP Library will eventually be a complex digital surrogate including:

1. A reader provides a transcription that strikes a balance between being faithful to the printed source while being easy to read and use on the laptops and other mobile devices that are the "tables of memory" on which 21st-century scholars do much of their reading and writing.

2. A viewer supplements the reader with good quality page images that provide the witnesses to check the transcriptions and offer modern readers a sense of the materiality of the text in its original embodiment. Over 300 of the texts have matching image sets. For more detail on the viewer consult the section on digital combos.

3. Data files provide access to bibliographical, structural, and linguistic metadata that can be used separately or in conjunction to explore particular texts and support forms of "distant" or "scalable" reading across the entire corpus or parts of it.

4. An annotation tool supports collaborative curation and allows users to offer corrections of the most common forms of textual corruption in the transcriptions. This critical feature of the library, still slightly clumsy, is implemented on this site and many student- and scholar-curators have already made thousands of corrections. (If you want to plunge medias in res, have a look at Mary Pix's Ibrahim, the thirteenth Emperour of the Turks, a text that could use a little attention.) For more detail consult the separate section on textual defects and data enrichment.

You must register before you can add annotations. That is the best way of keeping track of and giving credit to curators. Tell us what is not working. There is nothing like users to discover faulty design or poor implementation, so please let us know how we can make the site better.

**The ultimate goal of our project is to "re-mediate" the Early Modern print heritage, using the term as Richard Grusin and Jay Bolter did in their excellent book Remediation: Understanding New Media (MIT, 1999).** We want to enhance the query potential of the complex digital surrogates that are created by an ensemble of text, image, metadata, and collaborative tools. Surrogates fall short of their originals in some ways but may exceed them in others. This is especially true of digital surrogates. To learn more about our remediation, see Martin Mueller’s account of “[What is New About the EarlyPrint Library](/libbuilding)”
