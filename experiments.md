Links to various experimental interfaces and approaches, none of which is completely ready for public consumption.  We offer them as examples of the kinds of things we've been thinking about.

### Word embeddings and chunk searches

An example of [using word2vec to identify similar words](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/simple_word_distances/index.php).

An example of [using word2vec to identify similar word + pos combinations](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/pos_word_distances/index.php).

[Solr chunk search](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/solr_chunks/).

[Solr-Word2Vec chunk search](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/solr_word2vec_chunks/).  There's also [another version](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/solr_word2vec_chunks.V2/).  I'm not sure how they're different.

### Text reuse

[Text reuse pages](/textreuse/).

The [Genesis Viewer](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/genesis_viewer/Genesis.html), an experiment in using Blacklab to find text reuse.

### Rhyme and the poetry sub-corpus

[Topic modeling the poetry corpus](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/poetry.mallet_report.html).

[A list of what I think rhymes with what](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/terminal_phonemes/).  This is quite old . . . 

[Rhyme finder output from October, 2021](https://ada.artsci.wustl.edu/find_rhymes_results/).
