### Introduction

The URL of EarlyPrint takes you to its home page. Clicking on **Texts**
takes you inside, where you find your way around by using two search
tools. One of them is a list of texts with
a filter form for restricting which texts are listed, hereafter called
the **Text Filter**, and the other is a **Text Search** form. For our
purposes, filtering texts refers to choosing which texts are listed
based on one or more items of bibliographical information or other
attributes of entire texts, whereas searching refers to looking for
words within the texts.

### The Text Filter

By default, all available texts will be listed, ordered by title; to restrict that list,
use the form near the top left of your screen that looks like this:

![](/assets/img/filterdoc.png)

Select one or more criteria and click the <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">filter</span> button; the list will
change to display only texts matching all the criteria you specified
combined together. Click <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">clear</span> to remove the filter and
return to the default list of all texts. The table below describes the
filter criteria in detail.

<table>

Each text on this site has a TCP identifier which consists of five digits preceded by 'A' or 'B' and corresponds very roughly to the order in which the  texts were transcribed by the Text Creation Partnership. The familiar STC and ESTC identifiers are supported in addition to TCP; enter any one of these identifiers that you happen to have handy. For ESTC identifiers with prefixes such as "Wing" or "Thomason" do not include that part to find a single text; just the identifier will do. If, however, you want to find all texts having one of those designations, then do simply enter "Wing" or "Thomason" in the identifier field.</td>

                                <em>The Queen's Entertainment at Woodstock</em> has the subject headings:
                                <ul>

                                Searching "Queen of England" will bring up this play. Because not more than 20% of texts have Library of Congress subject headings, this type of search is of limited utility.

A corpus in this context is simply a grouping of texts falling within a particular area of interest.  A text may be a member of any number of corpora.  Currently "Drama" and "English Civil War" are available; other areas of interest will certainly emerge as we add more texts.

### Text Search

**Text Search** allows searching for a word or phrase and provides several
options governing how the search will be executed:

![](/assets/img/textsearch.png)

You enter your search term(s) on the line labeled **Search for** and then either
hit the return key or click the search button at the right end of that line to
initiate the search. Results will appear in a collapsible window immediatelay
below the list of texts; you may switch back and forth between the text list
and the search results by expanding and collapsing the relevant panels of the
accordion.

In the search results panel, the first five hits for each document will be shown
in context.  If you click on the link in one of the matches, you will be taken to
a separate browser tab where the match on which you clicked will be highlighted,
and any other matches on the same page will also be highlighted.  You may then
navigate through all of the matches in that document using the match navigation
buttons at the right end of the top menu bar.

By default, searches match based on "Standard Spelling," the initial setting of
the **Search by** selector. This means that "king of england" will match both
"king of england" and "kyng of englonde." If you want only the latter, specify
"Original Spelling" for **Search by**. 

The third option offered by **Search by** is "Lemma."  The lemma is the uninflected
form of a word, most easily thought of as the dictionary head word.  If you do a
lemma search on "winter be come," you will get "winter is coming," "winter is come,"
"winter being come," and "winter was come," among others.

The final option under **Search by** is "Direct CQL Query." CQL stands for
Corpus Query Language.  Its details are outside the scope of this document,
but suffice it to say that you many enter arbitrarily complex queries in a
powerful search language; read more about it [here](https://inl.github.io/BlackLab/corpus-query-language.html).

The **Filter by** option restricts the search to a single text.  Simply enter the TCP
identifier of a single document before executing a search, and only results from that one
text will be returned.  More sophisticated filters are planned but not yet implemented.

The **Sorty by** option dictates the order in which results are displayed: "Title," "Author,"
"Hits per document," or "Year." The default sort order it by title.

The **Per page** option allows you to specify the number of documents to display per page
of results.  It defaults to 10.

### Gap Search

The **Gap Search** feature is a shortcut that sidesteps the need to enter the unusual characters
used to record gaps of a letter, a word, or an unspecified span.  Simply select the type of
gap you wish to find and click the adjacent search button.  The **Gap Search** honors the 
**Filter by**, **Sort by**, and **Per page** options from **Text Search**.  Correcting gaps 
is described further in [How to Correct Gaps](/how-to/howto_correct_gaps.html).
