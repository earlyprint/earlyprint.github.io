### Introduction

The URL of EarlyPrint takes you to its home page. Clicking on **Texts**
takes you inside, where you find your way around by using two search
tools separately or in combination. One of them is a list of texts with
a filter form for restricting which texts are listed, hereafter called
the **Text Filter**, and the other is a **Text Search** form. For our
purposes, filtering texts refers to choosing which texts are listed
based on one or more items of bibliographical information or other
attributes of entire texts, whereas searching refers to looking for
words within the texts.

### The Text Filter

By default, all available texts will be listed; to restrict that list,
use the form near the top left of your screen that looks like this:

![](/assets/img/filterdoc.png)

Select one or more criteria and click the <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">filter</span> button; the list will
change to display only texts matching all the criteria you specified
combined together. Click <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">clear</span> to remove the filter and
return to the default list of all texts. The table below describes the
filter criteria in detail.

<table>

Each text on this site has a TCP identifier which consists of five digits preceded by 'A' or 'B' and corresponds very roughly to the order in which the  texts were transcribed by the Text Creation Partnership. The familiar STC and ESTC identifiers are supported in addition to TCP; enter any one of these identifiers that you happen to have handy. For ESTC identifiers with prefixes such as "Wing" or "Thomason" do not include that part to find a single text; just the identifier will do. If, however, you want to find all texts having one of those designations, then do simply enter "Wing" or "Thomason" in the identifier field.</td>

                                Searching "Queen of England" will bring up this play. Because not more than 20% of texts have Library of Congress subject headings, this type of search is of limited utility.

A corpus in this context is simply a grouping of texts falling within a particular area of interest.  A text may be a member of any number of corpora.  Currently "Drama" and "English Civil War" are available; other areas of interest will certainly emerge as we add more texts.

### Text Search

If you have not entered any filter criteria in the **Text Filter**, the
application shows you all the documents in no particular order. Once you
filter the list as described above, you can then open a particular
document and work with it, or you can run **Text Search** across the
subset of texts retrieved by **Text Filter**.

**Text Search** is a complex tool, and takes a little practice to become
familiar with its tricks. It shows up as a tall and narrow image on the
right side of the screen, and its top looks like this:

![](/assets/img/textsearch.png)

You enter your search term(s) on the line with the greyed-out text
"search for". If you click the line with the legend "Any Search Term",
it expands to a dropdown menu from which you choose the type of search
you will use. The line with the legend "Search Sections" expands to a
choice between searching in text or in headings and other forms of
paratext.

Text Search lets you search for words or phrases in various ways but
none of them are case sensitive. Here are the different ways of looking
for 'love' and 'death':

-   Entering 'love' and 'death' with **Any Search Term** retrieves 7268
    hits in documents that contain either 'love' or 'death'.
-   Entering 'love' and 'death' with **All Search Terms** retrieves 2494
    hits in documents that contain both 'love' and 'death'.
-   Entering 'love' and 'death' with **Phrase Search** retrieves 11 hits
    in documents that contain the sequence 'love death' with no
    intervening words but ignoring punctuation.
-   Entering 'love' and 'death' with **Proximity Search (ordered)**
    retrieves 141 hits in documents where 'death' follows 'love' with or
    without intervening words.
-   Entering 'love' and 'death' with **Proximity Search (unordered)**
    retrieves 222 hits in documents where both 'death' and 'love' occur
    in any order and with no or some words intervening.

In addition to that list **Text Search** also offers 'fuzzy', 'regex'
and 'Ngram' search options, each of which deserves a little explanation.

**Fuzzy searching**. 'Edit distance' is a usefuly concept for
establishing how close words are to each other. 'Cat' is one edit
distance away from 'Hat', two from 'Hit', and three from 'Hid'. 'Fuzzy'
searching is a way of looking for spellings whose edit distance stays
within some range. Fuzzy searching works much better with long than with
short words. Most of the time, however, you will be better off with the
regex search described in the next paragraph.

**Regex searching** "Regular expression" is the name of a very powerful
and widely-used pattern matching language. If you know how to use it you
will often wonder how you ever got along without it. If you don't know
it and looking for words or phrases is what you often do, it is well
worth your while learning about it, and even a little knowledge of it
goes quite a ways. Microsoft's Regular Expression Language-Quick
Reference offers a clear introduction.

The word 'love' is typically spelled 'loue' before 1630. The search term
'lo\[uv\]e' lets you look for either spelling. The square brackets are
'metacharacters' in regular expressions. The characters inside them are
alternatives. So the regular expression 'lo\[uv\]e' will retrieve any
spelling that begins with 'lo', ends with 'e' and has 'u' or 'v' in the
middle. This search retrieves 7570 hits. Having half a dozen regex
tricks up your sleeve will make you a much more sophisticated searcher.

The regex engine in this site has some limitations. It does not
recognize the non-alphabetic unicode characters that are used in
EarlyPrint for unknown characters.

**Ngram searching** Ngram is the term for a sequence of n words or
characters. There are unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, tetragrams etc. In
this environment, 'ngrams' refers to a sequence of characters whether or
not they are complete words. In most circumtances, regex searches will
be more useful, but because of limitations in the regex engine you must
use the Ngram search if you want to look for words that contain the
non-alphbetical characters. Use the following Ngram searches for
different categories of defective words:

-   The black circle '●' (\\u25cf) is the symbol for an untranscribed
    alphanumerical character. The Ngram search with that search term
    willl return 2617 hits.
-   The black small square '▪' (\\u25aa) is the symbol for an undefined
    punctuation mark. The Ngram search with that search term willl
    return 1659 hits.
-   The lozenge '◊' (\\u25ca) is the symbol for a missing word. The
    Ngram search with that search term will return 976 hits.
-   A horizontal ellipsis within mathematical angle brackets '⟨…⟩'
    (\\u27e8, \\u2026,\\u27e9 ) is the symbol for a missing 'span' or
    short passage of undefined length. The Ngram search with that search
    term returns only one hit.
