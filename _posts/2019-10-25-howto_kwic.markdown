A program to generate collocations from the EEBO-TCP corpus by Anupam Basu.  For questions, comments, bug reports contact the Humanities Digital Workshop or Anupam at abasu@artsci.wustl.edu.

Select a corpus, enter one or more search terms separated by a semicolon, and click <b>View Words</b>.  Searches are very literal; for example, entering love without spaces before and after the word will yield different results from entering  love with spaces before and after the word.

You can (and in some cases, you'll need to) narrow you search by adjusting the year range slider, by entering one or more authors (last names are best; to enter more than one author, separate their names with semicolon), and/or by entering one or more titles.

You don't have to enter the entire title; instead, a word or two will often work.
