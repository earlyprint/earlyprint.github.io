    <p><em>The EarlyPrint Lab</em> offers a range of tools for the computational
exploration and analysis of English print culture before 1700. We apply
these tools to a corpus of more than 60,000 early English printed
documents, roughly 1.65 billion words. We intend the <em>Lab</em> as a
provocation, not a finished toolkit. By exposing the corpus of early
printed texts at scale we hope to defamiliarize familiar texts and
invite exploration of unfamiliar ones.</p>

<p>The tools and visualizations collected here offer perspectives on the
corpus that invite users to probe early English discursive history in
ways that complement the search capabilities of EEBO-TCP and the <em>Oxford
English Dictionary</em>.</p>

<p>We begin with an <a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_ngram_browser.html?">N-gram
browser</a> that
enables one to examine the changing frequencies of words and word forms
over time. Like all the tools in the EPLab, the database also allows one
to browse by original spelling, regularized spelling, or lemma (the
dictionary heading form of a word), and to filter one’s queries by date
and by using part-of-speech (POS) tags. The N-gram browser links to and
pairs with the Linguistic Search tool.</p>

<p>We offer a Linguistic Search tool which allows the researcher to search
by individual word or by phrase. This tool allows search by original or
regularized spelling, by lemma or by part-of-speech; searches can also
be filtered by date, author, and title. The tool includes a query
builder that will allow the curious researcher to construct searches
that capture complex rhetorical patterns.

We provide two instances of
the Linguistic Search tool: <a href="http://ada.artsci.wustl.edu:8080/corpus-frontend-1.2/all/search/">the first instance</a> queries a corpus of
roughly 61,000 texts corresponding to EEBO-TCP Phases I and II; <a href="http://ada.artsci.wustl.edu:8080/corpus-frontend-1.2/am_ix/search/">the
second instance</a> queries the smaller Phase I corpus. This smaller corpus
is a more polished textual resource.</p>

<p><a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_discovery_engine.html?which_to_do=find_texts&amp;eebo_tcp_id=A43441&amp;n_results=35&amp;tfidf_weight=6&amp;mallet_weight=6&amp;tag_weight=6">The Discovery Engine</a> allows the researcher to select a text from the
corpus and to find others that resemble it by one or another measure.
Because ‘resemblance’ is a slippery concept, we implement several
differently suggestive measures. If you like Text A, you might like . . .</p>

<span class="thumbnail"><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[placeholder for catalog]</span>

<p>The Catalog offers information about individual texts in the corpus,
including not only traditional catalog metadata (author, title, place of
publication, etc.), but also formal metadata (word count, foreign
language word count, paragraph count, line count,
transcription error count). It also offers corpus-level views of
document metadata. It enables the researcher to develop filtered
groupings of the EarlyPrint corpus.</p>

<p>We also offer the first of what we expect to be a gallery of
visualizations of the corpus.</p>

<span class="thumbnail"><a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_eebo_estc_texts.html"><img src="/assets/thumbs/text_counts.png" alt="TCP books per year" title="TCP books per year"/></a></span>

<p>The first is a graph of <a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_eebo_estc_texts.html">TCP books per
year</a>, paired for
reference with a background graph of the number of publications recorded
in the <em>English Short-Title Catalogue.</em> It suggests changes in English
print publication over time and of the relative size and comparability
of the EEBO-TCP “sample.”</p>

<span class="thumbnail"><a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_words_per_year.html"><img src="/assets/thumbs/words_per_year.png" alt="Word count per document over time" title="Word count per document over time" /></a></span>

<p>The second is a <a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_words_per_year.html">scatterplot showing word count per document over
time</a>, producing,
among other patterns, a striking visualization of the sharp increase in
pamphlet production in the 1640s. But <em>caveat philologe</em>: some of that
sharp increase is an artifact of the history of the archive, for George
Thomason’s assiduousness in collecting Civil War pamphlets somewhat
distorts EEBO as a sample of printed discourse.</p>

<span class="thumbnail"><a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_phrase_search.html"><img src="/assets/thumbs/phrase_search.png" alt="Phrase search" title="Phrase search"/></a></span>

<p><a href="https://earlyprint.org/lab/tool_phrase_search.html">Phrase Search</a> provides a simplified interface for researching phrases and short passages of text, by automatically creating search queries based on both a phrase's form and its content. It is designed as a starting point for generating complex queries in Linguistic Search.</p>

<span class="thumbnail"><a href="https://earlyprint.org/download/"><img src="/assets/thumbs/download.png" alt="Download and examine catalog metadata" title="Download and examine catalog metadata"/></a></span>

<p>Finally, we offer a convenient interface for those seeking to <a href="https://earlyprint.org/download/">download
and examine the catalog metadata</a> either for the entire corpus or for a
subset thereof.</p>

<p><em>The EarlyPrint Lab</em> was conceived by Anupam Basu during his tenure as
Weil Fellow in Digital Humanities at Washington University; he aimed to
render EEBO-TCP more susceptible to quantitative historical analyses by
virtue of some intensive reprocessing of the TCP texts and their
metadata. Basu was assisted by Steve Pentecost, with advice from Douglas
Knox, John Ladd, and Joseph Loewenstein. The <em>EarlyPrint Lab</em> site is
supported by the Humanities Digital Workshop at Washington University.</p>
