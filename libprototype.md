<p><b>Welcome to EarlyPrint Library, a resource for reading a digital library of 25,000 English books published before 1700. In a few weeks, that digital library will more than double in size, so that it will represent virtually the entire corpus of early English print.</b> (The full surviving corpus of English printed books numbers roughly 110,000 books, but many of these are second and subsequent editions of books available in EarlyPrint.)</p>

<div class="fl w-100 w-40-ns">
The Library is based on transcriptions produced by the Text Creation Partnership. Those transcriptions could be better. <b>You can help your fellow scholar-readers by filling in gaps and correcting small errors in the corpus. Please become an EarlyPrint Curator.</b>
