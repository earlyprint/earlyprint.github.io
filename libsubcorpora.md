As the number of texts on this site grows, it will become increasingly necessary to filter by areas of interest rather than dealing with a list of tens of thousands of texts. There are a number of filter criteria available on the Browse page, and one of them is "corpus" Currently there are two corpora (subcorpora of the EP Library corpus, really) defined: Drama, with some 860 plays written between 1550 and 1700, and English Civil War, with a multi-genre collection of some 5,900 texts, mostly written between 1640 and 1660. Let us know what other subsets of early printed books you would like to see defined as corpora.

**The Drama Corpus.** Most of the texts in the drama corpus, and in particular the texts before 1642, have gone through several rounds of curation by three generations of undergraduates. Some 260 of them have matching images. About half of the plays before 1642 are proper digital combos. The majority of the images come from the Thomas Pennant Barton Collection in the Boston Public Library and are mediated over an IIIF server at the Internet Archive. For more detail consult the section on digital combos.

**The English Civil War Corpus.** The 5,900 texts in this corpus are a hodge-podge, consisting mostly of shorter texts ( < 50,000 words) from the English Civil War (1640-60). Only a few dozen texts are digital combos. They are mainly Civil War pamphlets, but they include Purchas His Pilgrimage, an endless but fascinting ethnographic compilation from the early 17th century with an image set from the Newberry Library. This text has undergone substantial curation by a group of undergraduates.
